                    Writing about yourself is a bit awkward, the hardest part is figuring out how to start -

                    incredibly excited about this field. The possibities of code seem endless
                    and I've found it difficult to put the assignments down because each one presents a new
                    engaging puzzle. I graduated with honors from University of North Texas, my Bachelor of 
                    Science degree is in Integrative Studies with focuses in Biology, Public Service, and Economics.

                    My primary goal is to continue learning all that I can about coding, as this field is so vast
                    and has no shortages of new things to learn. My plan is to use coding to pursue a career in 
                    bioinformatics. However, I'm leaving my options open moving forward from this class because there
                    are so many avenues left to explore.
